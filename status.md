# Brian McKenna's Projects

## [bilby.js](http://github.com/pufuwozu/bilby.js)

*Progress*

I'm going to be giving a workshop using bilby.js so I've got a lot of
ideas and improvements to make.

## [osxmonad](http://github.com/pufuwozu/osxmonad)

*On pause*

osxmonad doesn't currently work with spaces. OS X has no official API
for spaces and seemingly broke all unofficial ones in Mountain
Lion. Hyperspaces [ran into the same
problem](http://thecocoabots.com/blog/post/377/). I can make small
improvements to osxmonad but I don't want to invest the time until it
can support such an important feature.

*Slow progress*

Rewriting the type system to use constraints. This will fix many bugs
(especially around structural typing) and will more easily allow
additional type system features.
